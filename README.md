# Scrape_Analyze


The assignment is submitted in two Jupyter notebooks with one csv file named mars_data.csv.  

The provide starter code was used as a basis to build teh scripts for both parts.  This time I tried to keep better notes in the # text notes within the Jupyter notebook script so I know better how to repeat the operations at a future date.

The script visits a Mars news website which contains planet data and weather data.

I struggled early with determining the preview informaiton, so I made some guesses until I got it correct.

I used ChatGPT as a source for information and also consulted with classmate Bobbi Fletchall.
